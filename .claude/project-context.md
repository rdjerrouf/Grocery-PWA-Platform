# Multi-Tenant Supermarket Platform - STATUS UPDATE 2025-09-18

## Project Overview
Building a multi-tenant SaaS platform for Algerian supermarkets using Next.js 15 (with Turbopack) and Supabase as a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS).

## ✅ CURRENT STATUS: FOUNDATION COMPLETE, READY FOR FEATURES
**All development environment issues resolved and multi-tenant architecture working!**

## Why Supabase?
- **Cost**: Free tier perfect for MVP, $25/mo handles significant scale
- **Features**: Auth, Realtime, Storage, Edge Functions built-in
- **Multi-tenancy**: Row Level Security (RLS) perfect for tenant isolation
- **PostgreSQL**: Full SQL power when needed
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent TypeScript support

## Business Context
- **Market**: Algeria-specific e-commerce
- **Target**: 1-100+ supermarket tenants
- **Users**: Arabic/French speaking customers
- **Payments**: EDAHABIA (16M+ users) and CIB cards via Chargily

## Architecture Decisions
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 App Router
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)
- **Multi-tenancy**: RLS with tenant_id in all tables
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage for product images
- **Realtime**: Supabase Realtime for live inventory
- **Edge Functions**: For payment webhooks and complex logic

## ✅ Architecture Working - Success Metrics Achieved:
- ✅ **Multi-tenant Platform**: Two stores (Ahmed Grocery, Carrefour Alger) working independently
- ✅ **Page Performance**: Development server running smoothly with Turbopack
- ✅ **Admin Interface**: Tenant management working at localhost:3000/admin
- ✅ **Internationalization**: Arabic (RTL) and French text rendering correctly
- ✅ **Database Isolation**: PostgreSQL with RLS ensuring tenant data separation
- ✅ **Authentication Foundation**: SignInForm component created and working

## Target Success Metrics (Production):
- Page load < 3 seconds on 3G
- 99.9% uptime (Supabase SLA)
- 95% payment success rate
- 3+ active tenants in 6 months

## Current Development Context
**✅ All constraints successfully addressed:**
- ✅ **Budget**: Using Supabase free tier for development (localhost stack)
- ✅ **Team**: Single developer workflow optimized with Claude Code assistance
- ✅ **Languages**: Arabic (RTL) and French UI implemented and working
- ✅ **Region**: Algeria-focused features (DZD currency, wilaya structure ready)
- ✅ **Development Environment**: Fully functional with hot reloading

## Next Development Phase
