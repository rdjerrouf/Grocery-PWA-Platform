# Next Phase Development Plan - UPDATED 2025-09-18

## Phase 2: Core Feature Development (READY TO START)

### 🎯 Current Status - FOUNDATION COMPLETE!
✅ **Completed Phase 1 + Environment Setup**: Full development environment working
- ✅ Modern auth helpers implementation
- ✅ Server actions for all mutations
- ✅ Proper middleware for tenant routing
- ✅ Complete `.claude/` documentation framework
- ✅ **DEBUGGING COMPLETE**: All development issues resolved
- ✅ **MULTI-TENANT WORKING**: Both stores accessible with proper isolation
- ✅ **ADMIN PANEL FUNCTIONAL**: Tenant management working at `/admin`
- ✅ **DATABASE READY**: PostgreSQL with RLS and tenant isolation configured

### 📋 **Phase 2 Objectives (Next 2-3 weeks) - IMMEDIATE START**

#### **Week 1: Core Feature Implementation** 🚀

##### **Priority 1: Product Catalog System** ⚡
```sql
-- Database tables to create:
1. categories (multilingual product categories)
2. products (full product catalog with RLS)
3. product_images (Supabase Storage integration)
```

**IMMEDIATE Tasks (Next Session):**
- [ ] Create products and categories tables with proper RLS
- [ ] Build admin product management interface
- [ ] Implement product display components for store pages
- [ ] Add image upload functionality with Supabase Storage
- [ ] Create product search and filtering

##### **Priority 2: Authentication & User Management** 🔧
**Complete the authentication system:**

**Auth Components (SignInForm already created ✅):**
- ✅ `components/auth/SignInForm.tsx` - Already implemented and working
- [ ] `components/auth/SignUpForm.tsx` - Create with tenant association
- [ ] `components/auth/SignOutButton.tsx` - Server action integration
- [ ] Auth pages: `/stores/[slug]/auth/signin` and `/stores/[slug]/auth/signup`

**Enhanced Components:**
- [ ] `components/layout/Header.tsx` - Show user auth state
- [ ] `components/layout/StoreLayout.tsx` - Enhanced with user context
- [ ] `components/shop/ProductCard.tsx` - Add to cart functionality
- [ ] `components/shop/SearchBar.tsx` - Real-time product search

#### **Week 2: Shopping Cart & Orders**

##### **Priority 3: Shopping Cart System** 🛒
**Database:**
- [ ] Create `cart_items` table with RLS policies
- [ ] Implement cart persistence for authenticated users
- [ ] Guest cart handling with session storage

**Frontend:**
- [ ] Update `stores/useCartStore.ts` to work with Supabase
- [ ] Cart page at `/stores/[slug]/cart`
- [ ] Add to cart server actions
- [ ] Cart quantity management

##### **Priority 4: Basic Order System** 📦
- [ ] Create `orders` and `order_items` tables
- [ ] Simple checkout flow (no payments yet)
- [ ] Order confirmation page
- [ ] Basic order history for users
- [ ] Admin order management interface

#### **Week 3: Store Pages & Authentication Flow**

##### **Priority 5: Complete Store Experience** 🏪
**Rebuild store pages with server components:**
- [ ] `app/stores/[slug]/page.tsx` - Product catalog
- [ ] `app/stores/[slug]/search/page.tsx` - Search results
- [ ] `app/stores/[slug]/cart/page.tsx` - Cart management
- [ ] `app/stores/[slug]/checkout/page.tsx` - Order placement

**Authentication Pages:**
- [ ] `app/stores/[slug]/auth/signin/page.tsx`
- [ ] `app/stores/[slug]/auth/signup/page.tsx`
- [ ] `app/stores/[slug]/auth/confirm-email/page.tsx`

### 🧪 **Testing Strategy (Continuous)**

#### **Feature Testing (As We Build)**
- [ ] Test each new table with RLS policies for tenant isolation
- [ ] Verify authentication flows work correctly
- [ ] Test cart functionality across sessions
- [ ] Ensure multi-language content displays properly

#### **E2E Testing (After Core Features)**
- [ ] Complete shopping flow: Browse → Add to Cart → Checkout
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation: Data never leaks between tenants
- [ ] Authentication: Sign up → Sign in → Shopping → Sign out
- [ ] Admin features: Create products → Manage orders

#### **Performance Testing**
- [ ] Page load times < 2 seconds
- [ ] Database queries < 200ms
- [ ] Image loading optimization

### 🚀 **Phase 3 Preview: Advanced Features**

**After Phase 2 completion, Phase 3 will focus on:**
- Payment integration (Chargily Pay)
- Admin dashboard analytics
- Real-time inventory management
- PWA optimization
- Performance improvements

### 📊 **Success Metrics for Phase 2**

- [ ] All core database tables implemented with RLS
- [ ] Complete authentication flow working
- [ ] Product catalog functional with real data
- [ ] Cart system working across sessions
- [ ] All tests passing with new architecture
- [ ] No remaining legacy code patterns

### 🔧 **Development Guidelines**

#### **Use New Patterns:**
- Server components for data fetching
- Server actions for all mutations
- Proper error boundaries
- TypeScript strict mode
- RLS policies for all data access

#### **Follow Templates:**
- Use `.claude/templates/` for consistent patterns
- Reference `.claude/conventions.md` for coding standards
- Use `.claude/prompts/` for development assistance

### 🆘 **Potential Blockers & Solutions**

**✅ NO CURRENT BLOCKERS!** All previous issues resolved:
- ✅ Environment setup complete
- ✅ Authentication components working
- ✅ Admin panel accessible
- ✅ Multi-tenant routing functional
- ✅ Database connections established

**Proactive Solutions Ready:**
- **Product Images**: Use Supabase Storage with RLS policies
- **Search Performance**: Start simple, optimize with database indexes later
- **Cart Complexity**: Begin with basic add/remove, enhance gradually
- **Reference Templates**: Use `.claude/templates/` for consistent patterns

### 📈 **Key Performance Indicators**

- **Development Velocity**: Components migrated per week
- **Code Quality**: TypeScript errors = 0, ESLint warnings < 5
- **Test Coverage**: >90% for critical paths
- **Database Performance**: Query times < 200ms average
- **User Experience**: Page load times < 2 seconds

## 🎯 **READY TO START BUILDING FEATURES!**

**Development Environment Status:**
- ✅ Next.js 15 + Turbopack running on localhost:3000
- ✅ Supabase local stack running on localhost:54321
- ✅ PostgreSQL accessible on localhost:54322
- ✅ Admin panel working at localhost:3000/admin
- ✅ Two working tenants: ahmed-grocery & carrefour-alger
