## Current Focus (Next Phase)
ðŸŽ¯ **Ready for Phase 2: Component Modernization & Database Implementation**

**Priority Tasks:**
1. Create Supabase database schema with RLS policies
2. Rebuild components with new server action patterns
3. Implement modern cart system with auth integration
4. Create complete authentication flow

## Technical Decisions Made
- âœ… Use RLS instead of schemas for multi-tenancy (simpler)
- âœ… Server Components for data fetching
- âœ… Server Actions for mutations
- âœ… Supabase Storage for images
- âœ… Edge Functions for webhooks

## Blockers
- Need Chargily Pay test account
- Waiting for Arabic translations
- Need tenant logos and branding

## Questions to Resolve
1. How to handle inventory reservations during checkout?
2. Should we use Supabase Realtime for cart sync?
3. Email service - Resend or Supabase built-in?
4. How to structure delivery zones in PostGIS?
